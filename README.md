# Reconciliation
#Definition

According to Wikipedia, Reconciliation can be defined as “A procedure for confirming that the
balance in a chequebook matches the corresponding bank statement. This is normally done by
preparing a bank reconciliation statement.”

In the AA context, it is the process of ensuring that all processed transactions from AA
have counterparts with the respective schemes (like a credit card provider), i.e. there are no
transactions which are not accounted for.

#Coding Task
Lets assume we want to build a reconciliation system for AA. This means we will have to
process multiple input files, one on the AA side (transactions-AA.csv) and one per
counterparty (transactions-simplepay.csv, transactions-simplerpay.csv, transactionsharderpay.
csv).
